Systems Integration CA1: Build a Custom Shell for Linux.

Simple implementation of shell in C: read, parse, fork, exec and wait. Includes internal commands dt (date) and ud (user data) and external commands pwd (pd), ifconfig (ifc). This shell can be used as the default shell for a user upon login.
